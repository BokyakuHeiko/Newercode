# Newercode
**Newercode** is a upcoming project that aims to be a new emoji database, that is smaller, open and more leaned towards community


**Newercode** had several names behind the scenes, and this obviously became the public one to avoid copyright.


# Newcode
**Newcode** is the name of each code for an addition, such as, if we add a flag, it will be a **Newcode**


# Why Newercode?
**Newercode** started when **me** got a bit furious to the fact that another organization has basically denied some symbols that could be very important, including pride flags


**Newercode** will develop slowly, but eventually will have what it needs.
